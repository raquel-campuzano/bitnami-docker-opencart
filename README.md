# What is OpenCart?

> OpenCart is a free and open source e-commerce platform for online merchants. It provides a professional and reliable foundation for a successful online store.

# Prerequisites

To run this application you need Docker Engine 1.10.0. Docker Compose is recomended with a version 1.6.0 or later.

## Run OpenCart with a Database Container

Running OpenCart with a database server is the recommended way. You can either use docker-compose or run the containers manually.

### Run the application using Docker Compose

This is the recommended way to run OpenCart. You can use the following docker compose template:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    volumes:
      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
  application:
    image: 'bitnami/opencart:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - 'opencart_data:/bitnami/opencart'
      - 'apache_data:/bitnami/apache'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
volumes:
  mariadb_data:
    driver: local
  opencart_data:
    driver: local
  apache_data:
    driver: local
```

### Run the application manually

If you want to run the application manually instead of using docker-compose, these are the basic steps you need to run:

1. Create a new network for the application and the database:

  ```bash
  $ docker network create opencart_network
  ```

2. Start a MariaDB database in the network generated:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb --net=opencart_network bitnami/mariadb
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to OpenCart to resolve the host

3. Run the OpenCart container:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name opencart --net=opencart_network bitnami/opencart
  ```

Then you can access the OpenCart storefront at http://your-ip/. To access the administration area, logon to http://your-ip/admin

  *Note:* If you want to access your application from a public IP or hostname you need to configure OpenCart for it. You can handle it adjusting the configuration of the instance by setting the environment variable "OPENCART_HOST" to your public IP or hostname.

## Persisting your application

If you remove every container all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the application will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed. 
 
 If you are using docker-compose your data will be persistent as long as you don't remove `mariadb_data` and `opencart_data` and `apache_data` volumes.

To avoid inadvertent removal of these volumes you can [mount host directories as data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/). Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

> **Note!** If you have already started using your application, follow the steps on [backing](#backing-up-your-application) up to pull the data from your running container down to your host.

### Mount persistent folders in the host using docker-compose


This requires a minor change to the `docker-compose.yml` template previously shown:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/your/local/mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
  opencart:
    image: 'bitnami/opencart:latest'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/opencart-persistence:/bitnami/opencart'
      - '/path/to/apache-persistence:/bitnami/apache'
```

### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

In this case you need to specify the directories to mount on the run command. The process is the same than the one previously shown:

1. Create a network (if it does not exist):

  ```bash
  $ docker network create opencart-tier
  ```

2. Create a MariaDB container with host volume:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb \
    --net opencart-tier \
    --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami/mariadb \
    bitnami/mariadb:latest
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to OpenCart to resolve the host

3. Create the OpenCart container with host volumes:

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d --name opencart -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    --net opencart-tier \
    --volume /path/to/opencart-persistence:/bitnami/opencart \
    --volume /path/to/apache-persistence:/bitnami/apache \
    bitnami/opencart:latest
  ```

# Upgrade this application

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and OpenCart, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the OpenCart container. For the MariaDB upgrade see https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/blob/master/README.md#upgrade-this-image

1. Get the updated images:

  ```bash
  $ docker pull bitnami/opencart:latest
  ```

2. Stop your container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop opencart`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker stop opencart`

3. (For non-compose execution only) Create a [backup](#backing-up-your-application) if you have not mounted the opencart folder in the host.

4. Remove the currently running container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose rm -v opencart`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker rm -v opencart`

5. Run the new image

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose start opencart`
 * For manual execution ([mount](#mount-persistent-folders-manually) the directories if needed): `docker run --name opencart bitnami/opencart:latest`

# Configuration
## Environment variables
 When you start the opencart image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the docker run command line. If you want to add a new environment variable:

 * For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section:
```yaml
application:
  image: bitnami/opencart:latest
  ports:
    - 80:80
    - 443:443
  environment:
    - OPENCART_HOST=your_host
  volumes:
      - opencart_data:/bitnami/opencart
      - apache_data:/bitnami/apache
      - php_data:/bitnami/php
```

 * For manual execution add a `-e` option with each variable and value:

```bash
 $ docker run -d -e OPENCART_PASSWORD=my_password -p 80:80 --name opencart -v /your/local/path/bitnami/opencart:/bitnami/opencart --network=opencart_network bitnami/opencart
```

Available variables:

 - `OPENCART_USER_NAME`: OpenCart application User's First Name. Default: **user**
 - `OPENCART_PASSWORD`: OpenCart application password. Default: **bitnami1**
 - `OPENCART_EMAIL`: OpenCart application email. Default: **user@example.com**
 - `OPENCART_HOST`: OpenCart Host Server.
 - `MARIADB_PASSWORD`: Root password for the MariaDB.
 - `MARIADB_HOST`: Hostname for MariaDB server. Default: **mariadb**
 - `MARIADB_PORT`: Port used by MariaDB server. Default: **3306**


## SMTP Configuration

To configure OpenCart to send email using SMTP you can set the following environment variables:
 - `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP host.
 - `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP port.
 - `SMTP_USER`: SMTP account user.
 - `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP account password.
 - `SMTP_PROTOCOL`: SMTP protocol.

This would be an example of SMTP configuration using a GMail account:

 * docker-compose:

```yaml
  application:
    image: bitnami/opencart:latest
    ports:
      - 80:80
    environment:
      - SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
      - SMTP_PORT=587
      - SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
      - SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
```

 * For manual execution:

```bash
 $ docker run -d -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com -e SMTP_PORT=587 -e SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com -e SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password -p 80:80 --name opencart -v /your/local/path/bitnami/opencart:/bitnami/opencart --net=opencart_network bitnami/opencart
```

# Backing up your application

To backup your application data follow these steps:

1. Stop the running container:

  * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop opencart`
  * For manual execution: `$ docker stop opencart`

2. Copy the OpenCart data folder in the host:

  ```bash
  $ docker cp /your/local/path/bitnami:/bitnami/opencart
  ```

# Restoring a backup

To restore your application using backed up data simply mount the folder with OpenCart data in the container. See [persisting your application](#persisting-your-application) section for more info.
